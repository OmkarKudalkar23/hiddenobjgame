## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions
- `loadRoom(roomIndex)` - Loads a specific room with its objects and background
- `createDoor(position, rotation)` - Creates a 3D door mesh in the scene
- `showDoorAnimation()` - Animates the door opening
- `transitionToNextRoom()` - Handles fade transition between rooms
- `showRoomTransition(roomName)` - Displays room name overlay
- `updateRoomProgress()` - Updates the progress indicator dots

### Game Flow
1. Player starts in Room 1 (The Entrance Hall)
2. Find all objects in the room (clues guide the player)
3. Door appears and opens with animation
4. Fade to black transition
5. Next room loads with new background and objects
6. Repeat until all 5 rooms are completed
7. Victory screen displays

## Customization

### Adding More Rooms
Edit the `rooms` array in `panoram.js`:

```javascript
rooms = [
  {
    name: 'Your Room Name',
    background: 'path/to/background.jpg',
    objects: ['Object1', 'Object2', 'Object3'],
    doorPosition: { x: 0, y: -50, z: -250 },
    doorRotation: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }
  }
];
```

### Adjusting Door Appearance
Modify `createDoor()` function to change:
- Door size (PlaneGeometry dimensions)
- Door color (material color)
- Frame styling

### Changing Transition Speed
Adjust timing in `transitionToNextRoom()`:
- Fade duration: `fadeOverlay.style.transition`
- Room load delay: `setTimeout` values

## CSS Classes
- `.room-transition-overlay` - Black fade overlay
- `.room-name-display` - Room name text styling
- `.room-progress` - Progress indicator container
- `.room-progress-dot` - Individual progress dots
- `.victory-message` - Victory screen animation

## Notes
- Doors are hidden until all room objects are found
- Players cannot interact during transitions (`isTransitioning` flag)
- Room progress persists through the game session
- Restart button resets to Room 1
- Score accumulates across all rooms
